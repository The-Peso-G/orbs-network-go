# This hook is invoked by git-merge[1], which happens when a git pull is done on a local repository.
# The hook takes a single parameter, a status flag specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge.
# This hook cannot affect the outcome of git merge and is not executed, if the merge failed due to conflicts.
